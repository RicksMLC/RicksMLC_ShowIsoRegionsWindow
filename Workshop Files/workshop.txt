description= Provides ability to show the IsoRegions Debug Window when running non-debug sessions of Project Zomboid.
description= The IsoRegionsWindow shows the known bounaries (eg walls) of each region and chunk on the map.  
description= This is important to know if you are running a high population game with respawn, and need to "wall-off" sections to prevent respawn.
description= In the game you can construct a wall and if there is a "pillar" object connecting the walls they will appear to be joined, but in the IsoRegionsWindow it will show a gap.
description= This mod allows opening the tool needed to identify the gaps and take action (usually removing the wooden pillar).
description= Note: The white wall boundaries will not appear in the IsoRegions window until you construct a wall or other construction.

description=     [*] Allow debug window:  Allow all players to open the IsoRegions window.  If this is 'off' the "Is Enclosed" moodle toggle option will still be available.
description=     [*] Allow Admin debug window: Allow the Admin player can open the IsoRegions window if "Allow debug window" is off
description=     [*] Allow Observer+ debug window: Any player with the access (ie: /setaccesslevel username observer) 'observer' and above can open the IsoRegions window if  the "Allow debug window" is off.  This allows the admin to grant players the ability to open the window without needing to grant Admin privilege to that player.
