description= Provides ability to show the IsoRegions Debug Window when running non-debug sessions of Project Zomboid.
description= The IsoRegionsWindow shows the known bounaries (eg walls) of each region and chunk on the map.  
description= This is important to know if you are running a high population game with respawn, and need to "wall-off" sections to prevent respawn.
description= In the game you can construct a wall and if there is a "pillar" object connecting the walls they will appear to be joined, but in the IsoRegionsWindow it will show a gap.
description= This mod allows opening the tool needed to identify the gaps and take action (usually removing the wooden pillar).
description= Note: The white wall boundaries will not appear in the IsoRegions window until you construct a wall or other construction.
description= 
description= Sandbox options: Allow debug window.  Unsetting this will remove the option to show the IsoRegions window.  The "Is Enclosed" moodle toggle option will still be available.
